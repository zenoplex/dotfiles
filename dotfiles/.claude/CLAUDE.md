## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

## NEVER EVER DO

- NEVER publish sensitive data
  - Never publish passwords, API keys, tokens
  - Verify no secrets are included in commits
- NEVER commit .env files
- NEVER hardcode credentials
  - Always use env file or variables
